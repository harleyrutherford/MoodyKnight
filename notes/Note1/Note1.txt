Bug Log

When sliding, if you move into range of an NPC, slide animation continues as usual but movement stops.
If you interact with an NPC during sliding, sliding animation will continue and loop while talking, 
	but no movement happens. 
Jeweler and Hunter dialogue is fine, but for Herbalist and Blacksmith the first page of dialogue always 
	appears instantly (instead of animating letter by letter), and after finishing dialogue the player must 
	hit space once more to regain movement.
